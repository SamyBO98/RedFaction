Hi and thanks for Downloading my 3D Model. (Mid-Poly Sci-Fi Door)

I used Blender to model and Substance Painter 2.0 to texture and apply materials to it.
It took me about 2 hours to do all work and i hope you like it.

Licence: You can use it for anything you want but you are not allowed to edit or change textures and upload it as your own model!

IF you want to edit my model you MUST CONTACT ME first! Here is my E-Mail : Andrijaa999@gmail.com

Thanks again :D
